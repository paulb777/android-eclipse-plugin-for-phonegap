      License
You may use any jQuery project under the terms of either the
MIT License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.
The MIT License is recommended for most projects. It is simple
and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on
what you can do with a jQuery project.
If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use
a jQuery project under that license.
You don’t have to do anything special to choose one license or
the other and you don’t have to notify anyone which license you
are using. You are free to use a jQuery project in commercial
projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.
